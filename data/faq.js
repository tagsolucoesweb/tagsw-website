      question:
        'Is it worth having a website nowadays with social media being the focus of people?',
      answer:
        'Good question. I believe it does. Search engines are still a major part of how to find business on the internet and having a good presentation card that might take an interested person to your social media or contact box will help your business to succeed.',

    {
      question:
        "Why should I hire someone when there's website builders like wix and webflow available to do it myself?",
      answer:
        "First of all no site builder gives you a ready to go website. You will need to spend time on it and make decisions about design and what's best for conversion for your project by yourself. Another issue is with the performance of the sites made on site builders. If you need a high speed website to be found on search engines it's better to look for other technologies.",

    {
      question: 'How do you work?',
      answer:
        'It starts with a chat. No commitment. First of all I need to be sure that I can solve your problem. After that we will discuss what you already have, brand identity, wireframes, layout, technology to be used and this will result in a blueprint of the project. With that in hand the next phase is to develop the solution, test it, make necessary adjustments until we have a satisfactory solution. The project ends if the deployment to the server.',

    },
    {
      question: 'You work only with web development?',
      answer:
        "No. I'm a designer that also codes. So I work with branding, logo, billboards, presentations, business cards, social media posts and arts. I also create UX/UI for web apps or mobile apps. Of course I do website layouts. Everything I create I try to do it in the best way possible for the design to become real, so I always put on the creative thinking how expensive it would be to print or develop a design.",

    },
    {
      question:
        "I already have a brand with a website and everything. I'm happy with what I have but I would like to go further. Can you help me?",
      answer:
        'Short answer: yes. Long answer: we would start analyzing where I see room for growth on what you already have. With that we can propose modifications on the brand, communication, website to seek for a higher conversion rate.',

    {
      question: 'Do you manage social network?',
      answer: 'I do not',
      expanded: false,
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you do maintenance on existing websites?',
      answer: 'I do. It just depends on what language it was developed in.',

// "Each project has it's own problems and should be solved with the right technology. There's some cases which a website builder will be enough to solve the problem. If's a page that will be accessed through a campagn, a site builder could be enough. If you need something with a high performance in search engines or with specific functionalyties than you probably will need a web designer to help you out."
